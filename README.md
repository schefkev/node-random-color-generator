# Node.js Random Color Generator

## Options

You can pass an options object to influence the type of color it produces. The options object accepts the following properties:

`hue` - Controls the hue of the generated color. You can pass a string representing a color name:

`red`
`orange`
`yellow`
`green`
`blue`
`purple`
`pink`

`luminosity` - Controls the luminosity of the generated color. You can specify a string containing:


`bright`
`light`
`dark`


## Getting Started

You can start by typing `$ node index.js` in the command line.


If you are not sure what else to do, you can 'ask' the command line. 
`$ node index.js ask`

If you wanna set the color to red, you can do so by adding the color to the command line:
`$ node index.js yellow`

And the same applies to the luminosity, you can do so by adding it to the command line:
`$ node index.js dark`
